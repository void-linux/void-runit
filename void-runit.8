.Sh NAME
.Nm void-runit
.Nd information about Void Linux implementation of runit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kernel
.Op Ar preceding kernel parameters ...
.Op Cm void.runit_readproctitle= Ns Ar 0|1
.Op Ar void_runsvdir
.Op Ar succeeding kernel parameters ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Void Linux uses
.Xr runit 8
as it's default
.Xr init 8
system.
.Pp
Like in case of any other
Linux based operating system, original
.Xr runit 8
init scripts have been slightly modified
to better suit Void's needs.
.Pp
Void's
.Xr runit 8
usually does right thing
on it's own, by default, but you
are free to tweak its execution to better
match your installation requirements.
.Pp
This can be done by passing
.Nm
arguments through kernel command line to
.Xr runit 8 Ns .
.Pp
Currently following arguments are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "     "
.It  Cm void.runit_readproctitle= Ns Ar 0|1
Disables
.Xr runsvdir 8
.Xr readproctitle 8 Ns Ap Ns
s
.Ar log
functionality.
.Pp
This might be desirable on systems where many
.Xr runit 8
services are damaged and are logging too many
error messages per second, causing
.Xr runsvdir 8
to consume excessive amounts of cpu time or
when system's operator is using other tools to
capture uncaught system log messages.
.It Ar void_runsvdir
This is name of specific subdirectory within
.Pa /etc/runit/runsvdir Ns .
.Pp
For
.Xr runit 8
it means same thing what
.Sy runlevel
or
.Sy target
means in other
.Xr init 8
schemes (like system V init or systemd for example).
.Pp
Eg. if you set
.Ar void_runsvdir
to
.Sy default
then
.Xr runit 8
will try to boot into
.Pa /etc/runit/runsvdir/default
directory (aka runlevel).
.Pp
Similarly if you set it to
.Sy single
then
.Xr runit 8
will boot into
.Pa /etc/runit/runsvdir/single Ns ,
which represents
.Sy single user mode Ns .
.Pp
There is no limit in number of
.Sy runsvdirs
(aka runlevels, targets) you can create,
but these
.Sy runsvdir
names are reserved by Void:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "  " -compact
.It  Cm default
.Sy runsvdir
into which Void boots by
default.
.It  Cm single
Void boots into this
.Sy runsvdir
when boot error occurs (or when specifically
requsted by operator on kernel command line).
.It  Cm current
Symlink to currently active
.Sy runsvdir
on a running system.
.El
.Pp
If not specified,
.Sy default
is assumed.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Not applicable.

.Sh HISTORY

(Void's runit stage 2) script of
.Nm void-runit
scripts package.
